            be bound by these Terms and Conditions. Please read them carefully.</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>

            Controllers, and Energy Monitors, are sold subject to the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All hardware is covered by a <strong>1-year limited warranty</strong> against manufacturing defects from
                the date of purchase.</li>
            <li>The warranty does not cover physical damage, water damage, unauthorized modifications, or damage caused
                by improper installation.</li>
            <li>Products must be installed in accordance with the installation guides provided. Blinkdrop is not liable
                for damage arising from improper installation.</li>
            <li>All sales are final unless the product is received damaged or defective. Returns must be initiated
                within 7 days of delivery.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Software and Platform License</h2>
